# LongestPalindrom

The logic given here start from the center, two cursors are moved left and right respectively one character at a time those values should be equal.

We need to focus on 2 areas mainly
1. Calculating all even length palindrom strings : Need to concider centor with 1 chars 
2. Calculating all odd length palindrom strings. : Need to concider centor with 2 chars 

checkEquality() :
	  In this method equality is checked starting from the center moving one character left and one character right from the center. If both chars are equal then the next set of         chars are checked.
